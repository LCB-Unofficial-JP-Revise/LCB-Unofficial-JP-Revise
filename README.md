# Limbus Company - JP Translation Revision

This project aims to identify and correct typographical errors and some mistranslations found in the official Japanese localization of **Limbus Company**, and to provide a report documenting those corrections.

- All proofreading is conducted on [ParaTranz](https://paratranz.cn/projects/14860), and the reports are generated based on the results.

- As a by-product, a Mod utilizing the game's **custom language feature** is also provided. This allows project contributors to check the corrections in-game.
